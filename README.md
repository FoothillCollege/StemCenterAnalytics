********************************************** Project Currently Under Construction **********************************************
Foothill College's Stem Center Analytics system is now in Alpha!

View the data-visualization dashboard portion of the project at:

** Frontend Development Status:
   * Course selection bar is not yet functional
   * Labels are not complete
   * Shift to highcharts.js not complete
   * Other graphs not yet shown - including a graph similar to that of GitHub's user contributions heatmap
** Backend Development Status:
   * The data pipeline is not fully automated - data is still historical, no hourly updates YET
   * The backend RESTFul API does not yet support GENERALIZED interval/range/course calculation requests
   * Backend analytics API is not complete
   * However, all the pieces are there, it's just a matter of some further tweaking/generalizing code

PS: The project is NOT dead, simply on a break while contributors tend to other, more immediate
issues, such as the ongoing spring 2017 semester.
