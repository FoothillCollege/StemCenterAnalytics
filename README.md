## Future Features (Jeff Persons):

   * Generalized interval/range/course calculation http endpoints
   * Statistical functions in the backend API (all the pieces are there, but needs more fleshing out)

## Frontend Development Status:
   * Course selection bar is not yet functional
   * Labels are not complete
   * Shift to highcharts.js not complete
   * Other graphs not yet shown - including a graph similar to that of GitHub's user contributions heatmap
