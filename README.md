********************************************** Project Currently Under Construction **********************************************
Foothill College's Stem Center Analytics system is now in Alpha!

View the data-visualization dashboard portion of the project at:

** Project Status
The frontend's course selection bar is not yet functional, and the label's aren't dynamic yet.

After the dashboard's current features are polished over the next month or two, the beta version, to be
released this December, will have an additional graph similar to that of GitHub's user contributions heatmap.

Around that same time, the rest of the project (API and data pipeline) will have matured to the point of
moving the entire analytics system to hourly automated updates, and potentially real time (or close to it).
